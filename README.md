Code, survey instruments, irb protocols, and other resource for DRC mortality study. 


## Google Drive folders

The data/ and out/ folders are stored in a shared Google Drive folder called 

- 'drc-mortality/data' 
- 'drc-mortality/out'. 

Dennis can give you access to this folder if you don't have it already. Create symlink:

**On a Mac** you can do this by typing `ln -s PATH_TO_GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER`. 

For example, on my mac laptop, I was in the root directory of this repository and I typed `ln -s ~/Google Drive/_drc_mortality/drc-mortality/data/`. A symlink was created, and in my scripts I can now refer to the data/ directory to get to the Google Drive folder.I did the same thing for the out/ directory.
